Self taught coder, loves challenges, riddles and solving problems.

As well as my very nice technical skills, I also have impressive soft-skills,

that usually help me get to the position of the Go-To-Guy at any job I have.

Looking for a chance to show my worth.

Skills: Python | C | C# | Unity | Game Design
